## angular-sso-experiments README

This is a set of examples I have been working on with regards to integrating
Angular applications with Open ID Connect and OAuth 2.0. The experiments are:

* `azure-example` an example wiring Azure into an Angular application.
* `cas-example` does the same general thing, but integrates with a CAS 5.x instance configured to expose OIDC/OAuth.

If the code is useful to you, consider whatever I've written to be under the
MIT license (chunks are unabashedly lifted from the samples of other projects).
Do not consider this to be fully production ready or anything. It is exactly
what it says on the tin - a bunch of experiments.
